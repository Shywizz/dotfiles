## Dotfiles 
**âš  UNSTABLE** _DO NOT USE THIS_
personal dotfiles repository containing mostly up-to-date configuration files for software i use
### Structure
This dosen't have any, its managed locally through a good old bare repository
If i one day decide to add proper structure to this, this will be added
### Why is there scripts here
because i don't see where else they could go, so here it is.
