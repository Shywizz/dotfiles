# Shywizz's dotfiles repository
⚠️**THESE ARE NOT READY FOR USAGE**⚠️
I threw toghether this repo in hopes of not loosing *much* if I even have the urge to "distro-hop",
but **do not use these**, they are.. ugly, unpractical, and full of questonable decisions !

## Dotfiles 
If you're here, you probably either from my reddit post with 76 upvotes i didn't make yet \
Or you're lost. \
.. \
Here have this,
### Programs i use : 
Distro: Archlinux (i will not say the line)
WM: awesomeWM
Terminal: Wezterm / Alacritty
Colorscheme: *still waiting on the paint guy*

### Structure
If like most sane people you manage your dots with the `git --bare` methord then you know how this works
else [Use it, its amazing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)
You will find config for a little bit of everything, i like to tinker, hence the sheer amount of folder i have included.
